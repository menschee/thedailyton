The entrepreneur shed some light on different topics regarding the prospects of Fanzee. In the first place, Ajay talked about why they have decided to build on The Open Network. He noted that TON is capable of bringing the benefits of blockchain technology to everyday people, especially those who are keen on sports. \n\nCurrently, Fanzee plans to establish agreements with 50 clients across sports and esports by the end of the year. (It is worth mentioning that the Fanzee team has recently gone to Brazil for this purpose) Other than that, there was no mention of the upcoming FIFA World Cup in November. The event can benefit Fanzee greatly, which is why the project members work deeply with many federations.

We hope this mention will encourage the legalization of Toncoin and other cryptocurrencies in Russia.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5327834453571125539","accessHash":"-3063465926109260126","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,179,99,71,223,98,161,171,170,37,196,124,77,184,203,237,237,214,106,204,226,57]},"date":1664994197,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,216,124,198,147,25,233,254,127,90,0,140,199,33,233,49,28,122,31,92,210,170,72,98,101,105,48,197,178,8,236,42,77,135,223,252,254,53,12,234,237,178,28,29,173,157,216,56,226,128,30,136,225,193,50,150,25,52,85,123,104,86,7,102,71,36,238,198,220,246,206,57,20,80,5,250,40,162,128,10,108,145,172,171,181,186,117,226,138,40,2,40,45,210,54,44,50,79,185,162,138,40,3]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":16953,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":64427,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[7772,21100,43055,62750,96411],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":53,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":121,"length":64,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":193,"length":22,"url":"https://t.me/thedailyton/117","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":219,"length":23,"url":"https://t.me/thedailyton/167","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":373,"length":68,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":521,"length":55,"url":"https://www.ontvtime.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view_record&id=1606&start_record=2022-10-05-08-33","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":656,"length":38,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":694,"length":7,"className":"MessageEntityMention"},{"offset":694,"length":7,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":701,"length":10,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":816,"length":57,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":1243,"forwards":9,"replies":null,"editDate":1665262981,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":1,"chosenOrder":0,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":22,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üê≥","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":10,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":7,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëé","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":5,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üí©","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üçå","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"ü•∞","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"ü§¨","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"ü§©","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":1099392,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":false,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":178,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1664904302,"message":"Introducing the first search engine on TON\n\nIt has been several days, and the first projects developed on the recently-launched TON Sites have started appearing.

It will be moderated by active contributors in the TON ecosystem representatives instead of taciturn StackOverflow‚Äôs admins.  \n\nThough the decision is still pilot, we hope it will get feedback from the TON community.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5314614797637107506","accessHash":"-1751669290497601419","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,175,99,71,223,98,52,193,144,174,213,148,158,52,8,56,2,35,137,240,126,31]},"date":1664641850,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,216,124,231,252,41,187,7,249,20,0,195,28,135,164,196,113,232,125,115,74,169,33,137,149,164,195,22,200,35,176,167,133,29,198,127,10,121,33,99,44,120,0,80,4,72,142,28,19,33,35,36,226,138,101,171,52,142,204,204,126,148,80,5,173,170,78,72,25,161,64,29,0,25,244,162,138,0,40,42,28,96,250,255,0,90,40,160,6,172,73,31,42,184,162,138,40,3]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":16442,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":63785,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[7644,20569,41899,60380,93021],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":43,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":59,"length":5,"url":"https://t.me/thedailyton/142","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":82,"length":51,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":182,"length":75,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":358,"length":20,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":441,"length":94,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":814,"length":15,"className":"MessageEntityUrl"},{"offset":814,"length":15,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":860,"length":23,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":911,"length":123,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":419,"forwards":5,"replies":null,"editDate":1664641862,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":11,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"ü§î","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":4,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üò±","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":4,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"ü§¨","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":3,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"ü§Æ","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"‚ö°","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":1099392,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":false,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":174,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1664559601,"message":"Here it is: the basis for web3\n\nWe do not intend to repeat the same news that you have heard today ‚Äî TON Proxy & Sites releases. Let us better consider what perspective these will open up for the TON community and the whole world in general. \n\nFirst, with slow steps but TON Foundation continues to develop new and new technologies and constantly implement them into The Open Network. Community confidence has certainly grown in recent months, thanks to the active work of developers. This year has already brought us the first NFT-standards, marketplaces, a sea of the TON wallets, explorers, .ton domains, contests, and now TON Sites. TF showed in practice their desire to develop blockchain and follow the stated road map. \n\nMeanwhile, TON is starting to pop up on different world-renowned platforms, such as CoinMarketCap and NFT Calendar, as well as on crypto exchanges ‚Äî Huobi, MEXC, and others. We believe the TON community, all people gathered together in the ecosystem, are at the very beginning of something that will turn the world over.\n\nSecond, the recently-announced TON Proxy and TON Sites undoubtedly can change what we mean by the word Internet. Starting today, users can touch this buzzword called web3. Just set up an entry proxy and go to foundation.ton ‚Äî here it is, the upcoming opportunity to be in a decentralized anonymous part of the Internet built on The Open Network.\n\nWe are pleased to be one of the first English media about TON.

For example, the owner of the wallet.ton domain can hold an auction for selling second-level domains such as toncoin.wallet.ton, shop.wallet.ton, and others.\n\nWe are looking forward to the upcoming release, so we suggest the community familiarize themselves with the documentation in advance.

Today, we‚Äôre glad to announce that the core developer of The Open Network, tolya-yanot, updated the documentation on how to get started with the brand-new technologies.\n\nAccording to a GitHub page, to access TON Sites, users need to download rldp-http-proxy from TON Auto Builds, which will be available for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu later, as well as set it up with TON Global Config. Moreover, if you are interested in running your personal TON website, you will have extra to download a generate-random-id tool. We remind you that TON Proxy is a network proxy/anonymizer layer for TON nodes, similar to I2P. This key component, combined with TON DNS and TON P2P Network, will give decentralized apps immunity to censorship.\n\nVery soon, users will be able to not only access websites via TON Proxy but also create their own. More details on the process of launching your first web3 site are presented on the GitHub page. We expect the release to unveil on Friday, September 30.\n\nIf you have any questions, please, feel free to reach us via our bot.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5305484444490122404","accessHash":"7776487417866039202","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,172,99,71,223,98,250,196,119,0,247,49,144,67,106,45,93,225,66,7,121,208]},"date":1664382303,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,221,70,78,70,127,10,77,163,184,200,250,80,4,102,57,15,73,136,227,208,250,230,149,82,67,19,43,73,134,45,144,71,97,82,237,82,62,237,5,6,66,128,58,19,143,90,0,141,17,195,130,101,44,50,120,162,136,219,122,151,17,132,195,99,142,252,226,138,0,158,138,40,160,2,145,135,25,238,59,209,69,0,34,243,212,159,90,40,162,128,63]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":15085,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":57026,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[7152,18732,38029,54019,81236],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":36,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":69,"length":53,"url":"https://t.me/thedailyton/162","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":211,"length":80,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":307,"length":13,"url":"https://github.com/ton-blockchain/docs/blob/master/docs/web3/sites-and-proxy.md#running-entry-proxy","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":365,"length":37,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":492,"length":17,"url":"https://ton.org/global-config-wallet.json","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":520,"length":1,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":581,"length":57,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":799,"length":51,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":925,"length":25,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":982,"length":49,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1031,"length":15,"url":"https://github.com/ton-blockchain/docs/blob/master/docs/web3/sites-and-proxy.md#running-entry-proxy","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":1031,"length":15,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1080,"length":23,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1163,"length":11,"url":"http://t.me/thedailytonbot","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"}],"views":362,"forwards":11,"replies":null,"editDate":1664382354,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":12,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"‚ö°","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":6,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":5,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":3196544,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":true,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":171,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1664301635,"message":"Rift, a framework to build on TON\n\nThis summer, TON Foundation has provided grants to several teams of developers to build ecosystem-important products. One of them was dBuilder, a Python framework for smart contract building on TON. The developer aimed to create a tool to help programmers make the development, testing, and deployment procedures much easier.\n\nNot so long ago, dBuilder was rebranded as Rift, and, more importantly, the main contributor finished the work on the first milestone. The original framework developer recently launched a website with documentation on how to get started with Rift, lowering the entry threshold significantly for people familiar with Python. Now, it is available on GitHub.\n\nWe are also pleased to announce that in the near future, we plan to conduct a text interview featuring the developer of Rift. We ask our subscribers to send their questions regarding the Python framework via our bot ‚Äì the best questions will be rewarded.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5305311159739597066","accessHash":"-5944872976344509784","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,171,99,71,223,98,111,49,106,233,157,105,28,239,44,227,77,19,233,131,153,137]},"date":1664299752,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,216,13,199,131,249,81,132,254,229,0,68,99,144,244,152,142,61,15,174,105,85,36,49,50,180,152,98,217,4,118,21,38,23,251,149,91,80,145,161,182,204,64,130,199,146,59,80,4,200,142,28,19,41,97,146,104,172,205,54,121,126,210,168,89,153,79,81,69,0,109,81,69,20,0,83,100,141,101,66,174,50,51,69,20,1,28,22,176,195,150,69,249,134,121,205,20,81,64,31]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":15830,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":63489,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[7733,20730,41276,59936,92380],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":33,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":153,"length":79,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":295,"length":64,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":497,"length":51,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":548,"length":28,"url":"https://docs.skyring.io/rift/","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":548,"length":28,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":576,"length":32,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":694,"length":12,"url":"https://github.com/sky-ring/rift","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":776,"length":67,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":923,"length":11,"url":"http://t.me/thedailytonbot","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"}],"views":386,"forwards":8,"replies":null,"editDate":1664301743,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":11,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"ü§©","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":4,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":1099392,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":false,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":170,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1664208376,"message":"Apple will allow in-app NFT sales, but will apply 30% fees\n\nAccording to a recent The Information report, Apple, one of the leading tech companies in the world, will allow developers to sell Non-Fungible tokens (NFT) through its platform. \n\nThe community calls the company‚Äôs decision ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù since the 30% commission appears exorbitant to users who are used to paying a 5% fee on marketplaces like OpenSea, Magic Eden or Getgems.

Hope to see Fanzee will meet the expectations.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5292276904658845675","accessHash":"-5404584210517138699","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,167,99,71,223,98,184,3,245,0,50,172,72,149,12,72,152,111,223,79,143,230]},"date":1663951211,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,217,126,99,198,104,17,251,10,0,136,199,33,233,49,28,122,31,92,210,170,72,98,101,105,48,197,178,8,236,42,79,47,233,84,117,103,144,36,80,169,218,36,36,19,64,22,227,71,222,9,148,176,201,162,178,45,91,201,189,136,194,78,199,109,172,185,227,252,243,69,0,111,81,69,20,0,84,115,192,147,166,201,7,184,35,168,162,138,0,134,222,198,40,91,204,27,153,135,77,199,165,20,81,64,31]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":15265,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":57329,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[7344,18608,37432,53200,81517],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":21,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":112,"length":56,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":382,"length":60,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":510,"length":87,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":600,"length":6,"url":"https://t.me/fanzeelabs","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":652,"length":13,"url":"https://t.me/fanzeelabs","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":667,"length":66,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":846,"length":16,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":862,"length":13,"url":"https://t.me/fanzeelabs/94","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":862,"length":13,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":875,"length":121,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1228,"length":72,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":309,"forwards":5,"replies":null,"editDate":1663951225,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üèÜ","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":9,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":8,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üê≥","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":6,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üòà","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":3,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëé","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üéâ","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":3196544,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":true,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":166,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1663835846,"message":"Toncoin passed verification on CoinMarketCap\n\nCoinMarketCap, the world‚Äôs most popular price-tracking website for crypto assets, finally verified TON, bringing it up to the 34th place.

During the conference, Hyun mentioned The Open Network's advantages as well as expressed his opinion on blockchain's future. According to the Head of Incubation, TON, thanks to its deep integration with Telegram, has an opportunity to reach 700 million Telegram audience due to various solid ecosystem projects like @wallet or getgems.io.\n\nA recently-introduced web app's interface allows users to easily use their favorite cryptocurrency in a robust and user-friendly appearance without the need to leave the messenger. As Justin also pointed out, the process of both buying and sending Toncoin is made very simple so that even beginners can cope with purchasing tokens.\n\nTON develops as a blockchain with the prospect of integration into Telegram. Another ecosystem's fundamental project, Getgems, has partly integrated into messenger with the use of different bots. Finally, Justin Hyun shed some light on agreements with the messenger app: he said that in the future, when Telegram and TON would have different partnerships, users can be allowed to showcase their Non-Fungible tokens. Since every TON NFT collection has its Telegram channel, it will help the ecosystem to grow further, attracting a new and new audience.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5285460074300555642","accessHash":"-6558438120341949279","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,165,99,71,223,98,88,144,18,215,41,139,245,153,126,20,29,194,190,192,31,231]},"date":1663785331,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,216,13,252,231,242,164,10,59,140,254,20,1,25,142,67,210,98,56,244,62,185,165,84,144,196,202,210,97,139,100,17,216,84,159,47,247,127,74,163,171,202,194,56,163,4,170,201,156,145,237,218,128,45,198,143,188,19,41,97,147,69,99,88,59,65,117,22,211,141,237,180,168,39,4,81,64,29,5,20,81,64,5,69,115,111,29,204,101,36,92,129,200,35,168,162,138,0,130,219,79,134,25,60,220,187,184,224,23,57,197,20,81,64,31]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":15449,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":57296,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[7167,18900,38596,54209,80360],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":35,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":44,"length":6,"url":"https://www.certik.com/","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":162,"length":6,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7FOY73DHYM","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":162,"length":6,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":168,"length":77,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":275,"length":95,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":478,"length":85,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":563,"length":7,"className":"MessageEntityMention"},{"offset":563,"length":7,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":570,"length":4,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":574,"length":10,"className":"MessageEntityUrl"},{"offset":574,"length":10,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":686,"length":80,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1047,"length":36,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1137,"length":15,"url":"https://youtu.be/T7FOY73DHYM?t=1085","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":1203,"length":131,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":483,"forwards":6,"replies":null,"editDate":1664291130,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üçæ","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":10,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"‚ù§","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":5,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"ü§©","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":4,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"ü§î","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":3196544,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":true,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":164,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1663693217,"message":"7 reasons to invest in Bitcoin by Robert Kiyosaki\n\nRobert Kiyosaki, the author of the American bestseller Rich Dad Poor Dad, has recently posted a tweet with various statements about why people should invest in Bitcoin now.

The other reasons are low-interest rates, which are kept in the US for a long time. They force the government to borrow more dollars to buy more US Bonds.\n\nAccording to Robert Kiyosaki, these issues lead to another reason for buying Bitcoin: inflation. In fact, it has been on the rise since 2021, peaking in June at 9.1%. Other causes include forcing interest rates up and debts becoming too expensive. The writer also believes that the American currency is dying, so people should invest in gold, silver, or Bitcoin.

We believe such events allow TON to develop further and further.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5280889675046830292","accessHash":"1102186568022897310","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,163,99,71,223,98,98,4,110,186,182,84,148,213,237,206,26,174,78,5,141,230]},"date":1663602614,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,217,114,221,63,74,77,188,116,63,149,0,70,99,144,244,152,142,61,15,174,105,85,36,49,50,180,152,98,217,4,118,20,240,48,120,4,126,21,91,81,121,18,36,64,79,206,112,113,214,128,39,141,31,120,38,82,195,38,138,206,181,119,138,234,37,15,149,126,49,158,249,52,80,6,197,20,81,64,5,50,120,82,104,246,184,200,235,69,20,1,5,181,164,81,191,152,1,44,56,4,158,157,104,162,138,0]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":16478,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":66600,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[8133,22221,43983,63400,96956],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":50,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":63,"length":12,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":142,"length":95,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":261,"length":23,"url":"https://t.me/tonsociety/63","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":364,"length":70,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":659,"length":30,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":707,"length":18,"url":"https://ton.org/ton-test-challenge","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":863,"length":99,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":359,"forwards":3,"replies":null,"editDate":1663602623,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üèÜ","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":10,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":3,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üíØ","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":3,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üéâ","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üí©","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üê≥","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":3196544,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":true,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":162,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1663534505,"message":"What should Q3 2022 bring to TON?\n\nAbout three months ago, we made a post devoted to the end of Q2, describing what it meant for the TON ecosystem in detail. Today, less than two weeks before the end of this quarter, we would like to do the same: tell you more about developments that should appear very soon.\n\nBy the end of this quarter, TON Foundation must show at least two highly-anticipated technologies: TON Proxy and TON Sites. The first one can be compared with I2P (encrypted private network layer where nobody sees your location and activity) used to hide TON Network nodes' identity and IP addresses. In simple words, TON Proxy is an anonymizer to reach anonymity and security on the TON blockchain.\n\nTON Sites (or TON Network) is a fundamental technology that caters to decentralized sites. In principle, it is similar to usual websites but can only be accessed through the TON blockchain. TON Sites is an integral part of creating decentralized applications (so-called dapps) and web3 sites similar to the websites that all users are already accustomed to. In this case, all the websites can be accessed by .ton: addresse on-chain, meaning they will be functional outside the TON Blockchain, on servers available through the TON Network. \n\nThe Open Network can provide thousands of users with an absolutely new user experience. We believe that the launch of TON Sites, as well as TON Proxy, is likely to be an integral part of building Web3.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5276376381678273036","accessHash":"-2505706964517504641","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,162,99,71,223,98,35,76,239,254,46,170,153,212,15,73,74,124,53,134,36,33]},"date":1663532408,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,216,0,231,140,209,145,253,209,249,208,4,70,57,15,73,136,227,208,250,230,149,82,67,19,43,73,134,45,144,71,97,82,124,132,244,31,157,87,190,98,17,20,112,172,126,98,61,40,2,84,71,14,9,148,176,201,162,169,194,166,11,148,10,196,238,234,51,235,69,0,105,209,69,20,0,83,101,141,101,77,172,61,232,162,128,34,134,221,17,139,12,146,58,100,209,69,20,1]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":16623,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":69790,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[7872,21819,45690,67796,105397],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":33,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":165,"length":50,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":247,"length":61,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":364,"length":69,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":553,"length":57,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":641,"length":68,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":741,"length":60,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":915,"length":153,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1158,"length":91,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1306,"length":33,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1420,"length":33,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":584,"forwards":7,"replies":null,"editDate":1663534920,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":14,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üçæ","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":11,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":5,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëè","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":3,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üçì","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëé","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":3196544,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":true,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":161,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1663425001,"message":"Telegram's references to TON\n\nIt has been a while since Telegram shut down Gram, a cryptocurrency based on the Telegram Open Network blockchain. For more than a year, Telegram's legacy stayed under deep water until Pavel Durov decided to transfer original repositories to the developer community in late 2021. With the new Telegram updates, including full-screen and video emojis, and emoji statuses, the number of references to Toncoin (or Gram?) continued increasing.\n\nIn 2021, Telegram kicked off a new update that added video calls and, more importantly, animated emojis. Over the last year, the messenger app constantly implemented more and more animated emojis. Once there was added üëõ (click on it to see in full-size) that featured Toncoin's symbol. Later appeared üí± that showed the process of changing fiat currency to TON. \n\nTelegram did not limit itself to making allusions to TON on build-in emojis and, with the recent 9.0 update, rolled out the emoji pack with different icons related to the messenger app. Among dozens of emojis, there was one everyone knows ‚Äî üíé.\n\nMoreover, Telegram designers usually create fancy illustrations for every major update. And, interestingly, they sometimes depict Toncoin's image ‚Äî a diamond. In the last picture, you can see the diamond lying on the ground to the right of the house. Earlier, the brilliant appeared with the 8.5 update on a table in the laboratory.\n\nIt is still unknown why the Telegram team continues to feature either their abandoned project or spiritual successor (it depends on your attitude to these references). However, we believe we will get more answers as soon as June 2023 approaches, alongside the end of prohibiting the integration of cryptocurrencies based on Gram.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5272006312584138222","accessHash":"8866531740597984736","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,161,99,71,223,98,3,28,215,85,145,26,46,32,43,56,104,225,243,96,116,148]},"date":1663424693,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,212,133,50,122,3,73,176,250,47,229,64,17,24,228,61,38,35,143,67,235,154,85,73,12,76,173,38,24,182,65,29,133,73,176,250,47,229,74,228,71,27,56,3,32,80,4,104,142,28,19,33,35,36,226,138,88,39,243,139,2,8,35,154,40,2,106,40,162,128,10,25,67,169,86,25,6,138,40,1,171,12,113,156,162,224,158,51,69,20,80,7]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":14197,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":53440,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[7099,18279,36312,51907,78833],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":28,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":81,"length":62,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":185,"length":123,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":536,"length":38,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":668,"length":21,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":689,"length":2,"url":"https://t.me/emojistoncoin/2","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":691,"length":1,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":692,"length":33,"className":"MessageEntityItalic"},{"offset":726,"length":47,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":773,"length":2,"url":"https://t.me/emojistoncoin/3","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":775,"length":57,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":945,"length":75,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1077,"length":2,"documentId":"5773773228057038336","className":"MessageEntityCustomEmoji"},{"offset":1126,"length":42,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1230,"length":9,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1248,"length":12,"url":"https://telegram.org/blog/infinite-reactions-statuses?ln=r","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":1365,"length":19,"url":"https://telegram.org/blog/video-stickers-better-reactions?ln=r","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":1479,"length":53,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1603,"length":57,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":14765,"forwards":67,"replies":null,"editDate":1663425013,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":15,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üåö","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":9,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üòà","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":6,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üê≥","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üçæ","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëé","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":3196544,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":true,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":160,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1663345204,"message":"Tonkeeper becomes open-source\n\nTonkeeper ‚Äì the most popular TON wallet on The Open Network¬†‚Äì recently decided to switch the development mode to open source.

What about TON?\n\nFor more than 13 years, Bitcoin, a world-renowned cryptocurrency, has stayed uptime. The first Bitcoin was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3, 2009. That is how BTC's story began. The cryptocurrency made a long way and finally reached the milestone of five thousand days online on September 12, 2022. However, Bitcoin is not going to stop on it.\n\nThere were only two times when the cryptocurrency got hiccups. The first one was on August 15, 2010. Back then, an unknown hacker generated $184.467B worth of Bitcoin out of thin air that nearly destroyed the cryptocurrency. Five hours later, the blockchain was soft-forked, and nodes reached consensus.\n\nAnother hiccup appeared in 2013 due to switching the database that stored blocks and transactions from BerkeleyDB to the more efficient LevelDB. The chain forked into two, which led to double-spend attacks. In six hours, the problem was fixed, and since then, the blockchain has not experienced any hiccups.\n\nOn November 15, 2019, Telegram launched testnet2, which was renamed to mainnet in the future. With Pavel Durov's decision to leave Gram, a messenger app shut down its nodes. Fortunately, The Open Network's testnet2 was relaunched on January 2, 2021 (tell us if we‚Äôre wrong!) with new commits to the main repository. We do not surely know how much time nodes were not working, however, if you hold this information, don't hesitate to get in touch with us via our bot.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5260652978854019954","accessHash":"-2821822146268123351","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,157,99,71,223,98,104,82,76,53,252,162,19,34,20,59,239,163,207,22,161,96]},"date":1663091003,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,216,13,199,252,41,184,30,255,0,149,0,48,199,33,233,49,28,122,31,92,210,170,72,98,101,105,48,197,178,8,236,41,248,228,30,127,42,171,169,59,136,2,6,192,108,231,60,112,59,80,5,136,209,247,130,101,44,50,104,172,155,18,208,220,198,35,36,171,16,24,14,156,209,64,27,180,81,69,0,20,201,162,73,163,218,227,35,168,246,162,138,0,130,214,202,59,114,206,175,35,31,246,155,138,40,162,128,63]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":17261,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":68446,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[8021,22807,46647,67262,101432],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":48,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":135,"length":66,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":306,"length":18,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":325,"length":7,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":412,"length":14,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":513,"length":111,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":738,"length":111,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":861,"length":15,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":966,"length":46,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1221,"length":42,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1331,"length":142,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1473,"length":7,"url":"http://t.me/thedailytonbot","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":1473,"length":7,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":319,"forwards":1,"replies":null,"editDate":1663091235,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":10,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":4,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":3196544,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":true,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":156,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1662999001,"message":"The only real TON\n\nAfter the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had halted Telegram‚Äôs attempts to create a messenger-integrated cryptocurrency, Durov‚Äôs team left the project and handed it over to the enthusiasts to succeed where they failed.

The website constantly tracks the last blocks and calculates the estimated remaining time. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that all the details contained within the website are presented in a user-friendly way, meaning it is convenient to follow the long-awaited event.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5251647600665411209","accessHash":"-8089770140880393964","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,154,99,71,223,98,204,30,204,101,144,53,249,3,172,189,108,61,184,73,125,97]},"date":1662822516,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,157,126,114,127,165,41,9,143,187,64,17,24,228,61,38,35,143,67,235,154,85,73,12,76,173,38,24,182,65,29,133,72,66,127,119,165,86,212,28,197,106,90,49,140,142,212,1,50,35,135,4,200,88,100,241,69,83,176,145,220,163,5,33,91,140,246,52,80,6,157,20,81,64,5,54,72,214,69,42,227,32,138,40,160,6,197,10,71,247,84,12,112,61,168,162,138,0]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":15845,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":62847,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[7685,20889,41781,61252,94742],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":29,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":63,"length":28,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":139,"length":12,"url":"https://watcher.guru/","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":166,"length":41,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":210,"length":32,"url":"https://watcher.guru/ethmerge","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":299,"length":57,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":454,"length":72,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":711,"length":78,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":278,"forwards":2,"replies":null,"editDate":1662822606,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":9,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":1099392,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":false,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":153,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1662743112,"message":"TeleTON, a messenger app with TON support\n\nIn the last post, we showed you the stunning implementation of a classic TON Wallet to Telegram. Now, let‚Äôs talk about it in more detail: A few months ago, a group of developers came together to create a messenger app based on Telegram with a built-in wallet. The project named TeleTON set a goal to combine two apps, bringing users a more convenient way of using TON.\n\nFor the last two years, many TON enthusiasts have dreamed of seeing their favorite cryptocurrency integrated with the messenger app. Such projects as TeleTON allow you to see how Telegram could look if SEC (The Securities and Exchange Commission) did not halt Telegram Open Network.\n\nDuring the conversation with The Daily TON, one of the project‚Äôs developers shared that the team stopped working on the project as it did not find any interest on the part of the TON authorities. According to the GitHub repo, the app was updated in March last time. However, if people are interested in the project, the development team is ready to update the app and release it on App Store.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach us via our bot.\n\nUPD:

On a launchpad‚Äôs page, users can maintain information about the project, including its roadmap, team, project links, and much more.\n\nMore importantly, there you can buy NFTs right before the mint. In other words, you do not need to use external Telegram bots to purchase the artwork in advance.

We chose several answers that we found interesting and worth mentioning. Check out the full interview through this link.\n\nThe history of Disintar began on December 21 when Andrey was thinking of a present for his friends. Though he originally planned to mint an NFT on the Ethereum Blockchain, he changed his mind after Pavel Durov said support to TON. Disintar was the first-launched NFT marketplace on TON. Until Getgems came into play, the marketplace took the lead by volume trading. According to Andrey's words, Disintar has earned six figures dollars since it was launched. \n\nThe developers faced a myriad of problems on their way to building a project, including the TON technology's unfinished condition and the TON Foundation's unwillingness to support newcomers. Though Andrey admitted, the situation became a bit better. Disintar's current goal is to make TON more accessible to more users in every sense of the word. The team plans to introduce new stuff and products, some of which will be NFT-related.\n\nYou can always reach us via our bot if we've missed something.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5210891380388380164","accessHash":"-6618600509236182018","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,134,99,71,223,98,210,170,32,71,197,179,47,254,29,197,150,15,231,143,236,79]},"date":1661598488,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,152,12,159,240,160,1,233,145,142,152,160,8,204,114,30,147,17,199,161,245,205,42,164,134,38,86,147,12,91,32,142,194,164,194,147,247,58,211,102,96,145,114,8,30,221,168,1,17,28,56,38,66,70,73,197,20,232,102,89,70,1,25,199,78,226,138,0,151,0,158,131,154,7,96,40,162,128,10,70,80,195,7,235,69,20,0,213,133,35,98,202,184,39,2,138,40,160,15]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":16709,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":65395,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[7948,21658,43368,62055,93618],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":36,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":45,"length":9,"url":"https://t.me/ton_learn/21","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":74,"length":71,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":217,"length":71,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":327,"length":9,"url":"https://github.com/romanovichim/TONStories/blob/main/disintar.md","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":438,"length":111,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":549,"length":12,"url":"https://t.me/durov/175","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":549,"length":12,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":561,"length":7,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":734,"length":61,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":877,"length":111,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1028,"length":19,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1088,"length":56,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1262,"length":7,"url":"http://t.me/thedailytonbot","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"}],"views":265,"forwards":1,"replies":null,"editDate":1661599363,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":11,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":5,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"‚ù§","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"ü§î","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":3196544,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":true,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":133,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1661540101,"message":"Half of the daily Bitcoin trading is fake\n\nThe volume of traded cryptocurrencies on exchanges has always been controversial, as some people consider it bogus.

Only time will tell if it is true.\n\nAs the TON community, we hope all of these insides will come to life one day.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5195021729632729867","accessHash":"-6380542612299809779","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,125,99,71,223,98,245,153,63,139,249,78,93,210,79,80,138,207,241,33,52,125]},"date":1661153163,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,202,141,199,35,63,133,7,111,247,104,2,35,28,135,164,196,113,232,125,115,74,169,33,137,149,164,195,22,200,35,176,169,48,167,170,213,109,68,148,183,10,156,6,60,226,128,37,141,91,126,124,226,192,19,145,69,103,68,4,55,17,152,137,201,60,140,231,34,138,0,217,218,51,156,12,250,209,69,20,0,83,100,141,101,82,174,50,40,162,128,34,134,214,40,219,114,130,72,233,147,210,138,40,160,15]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":15834,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":64393,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[7655,20656,41524,61538,96250],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":28,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":159,"length":66,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":260,"length":61,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":481,"length":43,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":570,"length":26,"url":"https://twitter.com/DenisMatveevTon/status/1560553707745513475","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":601,"length":57,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":791,"length":66,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":917,"length":42,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":305,"forwards":6,"replies":null,"editDate":1661153443,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":12,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":6,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëè","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":3,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üéâ","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":3196544,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":true,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":124,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1661079470,"message":"KFC begins its journey in metaverse\n\nKFC India, a well-known fast food restaurant unit, announced the launch of the first NFT a few days ago.

For Uniswap, it was the first time the company made blacklisting data public.

These words often appear in crypto-related channels (our channel isn't an exception). Now, the time has come to find out who they are ‚Äì the two major actors ruling the blockchain.\n\nFirst, let's speak about validators. A validator is a network node that helps keep the blockchain running by verifying (or validating) suggested blocks and allowing to record them in the blockchain. To become a validator, you must follow two requirements: have a high-performance server and obtain a serious amount of TON, 600,000, to make a stake. At the time of writing, there are 227 validators on TON.\n\nIt's evident that not everyone can afford to have hundreds of thousand Toncoin on their balance ‚Äì¬†that's why nominators come into play there. Simply put, the nominator is a user who lends his TON to validators. Every time the validator earns the reward by validating blocks, it is distributed between the involved participants.\n\nSome time ago, Ton Whales ran the first staking pool on TON with the minimum deposit of 50 TON. Later, TON Foundation launched the first open nominator pool. Now, users may stake Toncoin in a fully-decentralized way, starting with 10,000 TON.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5460734648813469225","accessHash":"6248275819299299928","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,114,99,71,223,98,248,219,111,247,192,50,53,147,237,211,62,142,218,101,0,106]},"date":1660506081,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,152,114,120,7,240,163,3,178,143,202,128,35,49,200,122,76,71,30,135,215,52,170,146,24,153,90,76,49,108,130,59,10,126,7,160,252,170,174,162,197,33,80,128,141,253,72,160,11,8,142,28,19,41,97,147,69,103,88,151,142,117,199,0,156,17,158,180,80,6,197,20,81,64,5,50,88,146,104,202,184,227,168,246,162,138,0,142,27,88,225,59,129,44,71,77,221,168,162,138,0]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":18028,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":70565,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[8191,23205,47839,69437,106140],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":24,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":95,"length":25,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":258,"length":42,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":381,"length":119,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":601,"length":49,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":808,"length":42,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":985,"length":51,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1099,"length":34,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":1226,"length":28,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":19494,"forwards":44,"replies":null,"editDate":1660506097,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":8,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":3,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëé","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":3196544,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":true,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":113,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1660411692,"message":"Nigeria is curious about crypto\n\nA recent study by CoinGecko showed that Africa‚Äôs most-populous country, Nigeria, is more interested in crypto assets than other nations.

We believe the number of high bets will increase by the end of the week.","media":{"flags":1,"photo":{"flags":0,"hasStickers":false,"id":"5420506666564172807","accessHash":"3308950023322578635","fileReference":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,105,134,227,23,0,0,0,91,99,71,223,98,155,136,156,221,233,217,140,8,105,247,89,243,54,219,196,248]},"date":1659284115,"sizes":[{"type":"i","bytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,20,40,208,104,220,185,97,41,3,112,56,246,244,160,163,249,74,190,105,220,14,75,122,211,152,13,199,252,40,219,207,32,159,194,128,35,49,200,122,76,71,30,135,215,52,161,36,49,50,180,152,98,217,4,118,21,38,23,31,114,170,234,46,86,36,69,202,171,19,156,80,4,232,142,28,19,41,97,147,69,103,219,131,111,119,26,198,196,134,198,225,158,57,162,128,53,246,131,216,81,69,20,0,83,38,137,37,143,107,140,142,163,218,138,40,2,27,123,88,227,98,224,18,195,166,77,20,81,64,31]},"className":"PhotoStrippedSize"},{"type":"m","w":320,"h":157,"size":16327,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"x","w":800,"h":393,"size":67966,"className":"PhotoSize"},{"type":"y","w":1280,"h":629,"sizes":[8011,21813,44145,65241,101953],"className":"PhotoSizeProgressive"}],"videoSizes":null,"dcId":2,"className":"Photo"},"ttlSeconds":null,"className":"MessageMediaPhoto"},"replyMarkup":null,"entities":[{"offset":0,"length":38,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":124,"length":47,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":360,"length":15,"url":"https://t.me/tondnstracker","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":429,"length":25,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":474,"length":9,"url":"https://t.me/tondomen_channel","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":496,"length":42,"className":"MessageEntityBold"},{"offset":585,"length":3,"url":"https://t.me/TonDomenBot","className":"MessageEntityTextUrl"},{"offset":647,"length":60,"className":"MessageEntityBold"}],"views":288,"forwards":1,"replies":null,"editDate":1659285625,"postAuthor":null,"groupedId":null,"reactions":{"flags":0,"min":false,"canSeeList":false,"results":[{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëç","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":6,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üî•","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":4,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"‚ù§","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":2,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üëé","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"},{"flags":0,"chosenOrder":null,"reaction":{"emoticon":"üí©","className":"ReactionEmoji"},"count":1,"className":"ReactionCount"}],"recentReactions":null,"className":"MessageReactions"},"restrictionReason":null,"ttlPeriod":null,"className":"Message"},{"flags":3196544,"out":false,"mentioned":false,"mediaUnread":false,"silent":false,"post":true,"fromScheduled":false,"legacy":false,"editHide":true,"pinned":false,"noforwards":false,"id":90,"fromId":null,"peerId":{"channelId":"1770447639","className":"PeerChannel"},"fwdFrom":null,"viaBotId":null,"replyTo":null,"date":1659175620,"message":"The open auction has started\n\nToday, that day has come.

We decided to create the overarching post to cover this topic broadly.\n\nTON DNS is a service created for translating randomly-generated TON addresses into human-readable names with the .ton extension. After domain getting, you may connect it with any address on the TON Blockchain and use it for making transactions or keeping an eye out for your wallet via explorer.\n\nHow to get the .ton domain?\n\n0. Check if you have installed TON Wallet‚Äôs extension for Google Chrome.\n\n1. Go to dns.ton.org and enter the symbol combination that you want to become a .ton domain. (Note: the domain name must be at least 4 characters and no more than 126 characters).\n\n2. Send TON to the specified address and do not forget about a memo.\n\n3. Wait until the auction is over (Note: the auction lasts seven days, and if a bid is placed with less than an hour left in the auction, it will be extended by one hour)\n\n4. As soon as the auction ends, you may connect the domain to any TON address. Go to the page ‚Äì¬†that you used to place bets ‚Äì and press the \"Edit\" button. Enter your TON address in the required field and save the changes.\n\nThere is less than a day left before the auction starts, and there is more than a week before the first users receive their .ton domains. But you can even now try the functionality on testnet. \n\nNote: the price of domains directly depends on the number of symbols. The 4-letter names will cost 1000 TON while the cheapest ‚Äì from 11 letters ‚Äì 10 TON. You can read more about it in the article written by the TON Community.\n\nSoon tools to follow the auction will appear on Telegram, so even people who do not want to dive deeper into TON DNS will be able to buy the .ton domain without leaving the app. As soon as they turn up, we will make an overview of them.
